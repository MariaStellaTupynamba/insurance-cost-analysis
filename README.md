# insurance-cost-analysis
Data analysis project exploring how medical insurance costs in the U.S. disproportionately affect vulnerable groups. Analyzes gender, age, and smoking status to reveal profit-driven pricing logic and algorithmic bias using Python, regression models, and visualizations. 

Behind the Data: Profit Logic & Social Vulnerability
This project reveals how medical insurance pricing is not only based on health risk — it's deeply shaped by profit logic that exploits social vulnerabilities.

Women continue to earn less than men due to systemic workplace inequality. Despite this, women often face similar or even higher insurance charges, highlighting a disconnect between income capacity and premium expectations.

Older individuals are penalized for natural aging. As people grow older and transition into retirement — a period of reduced income — insurance charges rise significantly, monetizing the very phase where care is most needed and least affordable.

Smokers, while objectively higher-risk, are often used as a pricing lever. The smoker surcharge is steep — sometimes disproportionately — and may serve more as a profitability tool than a purely actuarial adjustment.

These patterns suggest that insurance companies, guided by profitability, may not only price based on risk but also based on how much individuals can't fight back — economically or socially.

⚠️ Algorithmic Bias Warning
With the rise of machine learning in pricing and claims decisions, the use of historical data can reinforce and scale existing biases. Features like gender, age, BMI, and even zip code (region) can serve as proxies for race, income, and social class, all without being explicitly labeled.

Predictive pricing systems can silently encode systemic injustice into the cost of survival.

This project combines technical analysis with critical thinking to show why transparency, regulation, and ethical scrutiny are essential when applying data science in sensitive sectors like healthcare.
